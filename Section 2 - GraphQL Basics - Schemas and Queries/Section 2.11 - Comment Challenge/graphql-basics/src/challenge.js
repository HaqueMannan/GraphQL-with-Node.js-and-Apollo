// Part I:
// 1. Setup a "Comment" custom type with id and text fields. Both non-nullable
// 2. Setup a "comments" array with four comments
// 3. Setup a "comments" query with a resolver that returns all the comments
// 4. Run a query to get all four comments with both id and text fields in GraphQL Playground (run the terminal command npm run start and in the browser go to localhost:4000)
