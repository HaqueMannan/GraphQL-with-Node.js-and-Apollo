// Goal: Create input types for createPost and createComment
// 1. Create an input type for createPost with the same fields. User "data" or "post" as arg name
// 2. Update createPost resolver to use this new object
// 3. Verify application still works by creating a post and then fetching it in GraphQL Playground (run the terminal command npm run start and in the browser go to localhost:4000)
// 4. Create an input type for createComment with the same fields. User "data" or "comment" as arg name
// 5. Update createComment resolver to use this new object
// 6. Verify application still works by creating a comment and then fetching it in GraphQL Playground (run the terminal command npm run start and in the browser go to localhost:4000)
