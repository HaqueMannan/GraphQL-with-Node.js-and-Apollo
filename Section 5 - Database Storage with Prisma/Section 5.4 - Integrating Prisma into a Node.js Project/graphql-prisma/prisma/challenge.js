// 1. Copy the comment type definition and mark the id as unique
// 2. Redeploy the Prisma app using the prisma deploy terminal command within the prisma project directory
// 3. Work with the comment API in GraphQL Playground (you would need Docker Desktop running and in the browser go to localhost:4466)
//    a. Update the only post to be published
//    b. Create a new user
//    c. Have new user comment on the one existing post (refer to DOCS tab for usage)
//    d. Fetch all comments (include comment text and author name)
