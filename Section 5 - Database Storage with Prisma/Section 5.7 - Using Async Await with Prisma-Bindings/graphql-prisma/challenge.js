// Goal: Use Async/Await with Prisma-Bindings
// 1. Create "updatePostForUser" that accepts the post id and data to update
// 2. Update the post (get author id back)
// 3. Fetch the user associated with the updated post and return the user data
//    - Grab the same fields grabbed for createPostForUser
// 4. Call the function with the id and data and use a then method cal to get the user information
// 5. Print the user info to the console and test the code by calling the function and running npm start in the terminal
