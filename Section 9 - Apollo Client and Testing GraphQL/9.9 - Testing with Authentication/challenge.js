// Goal: Write a test case for the myPosts query
// 1. Create the test case and an authenticated client
// 2. Fire off a myPosts operation getting scalar fields for posts
// 3. Assert that two posts were fetched
// 4. Test the test case (run the terminal command npm run test within the graphql-prisma directory)

// Goal: Write a test case for createPost and deletePost
// 1. Write a test for createPost
//    - Use authentication, assert that post exists in the database with correct field values
// 2. Write a test for deletePost
//    - Use authentication, assert that the second is deleted from the database
// 3. Test the test cases (run the terminal command npm run test within the graphql-prisma directory)
